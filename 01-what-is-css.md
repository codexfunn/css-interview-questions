## üîå How to Add CSS to HTML?

### 1. Inline CSS

```html
<h1 style="color:red;">Hello</h1>
```

**Used for quick, one-time styling. Not recommended for big projects.**

### 2. Internal CSS

```html
<style>
  p { color: green; }
</style>
```

Placed inside the `<head>` tag for styling a single page.

### 3. External CSS

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
```

Links to a separate `.css` file. **Most scalable and preferred.**
